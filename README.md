# AngularSparkAnalysisUI

Welcome to the AngularSparkAnalysisUI project! This web page is designed to display Spark table queries and provide users with an interactive interface to create and execute their own queries.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Getting Started
